Approved baseline and monitoring methodology AM0073
“GHG emission reductions through multi-site manure collection and treatment in a central plant”
I. 	SOURCE, DEFINITIONS AND APPLICABILITY
Sources
This baseline and monitoring methodology is based on the following proposed new methodology:
• 	NM0239 “Environmental passive mitigation through the management of the swine manure by a
Regional Sanitation Plant in the Santa Catarina State, Brazil” prepared by Brescel Energia Ltda
and MundusCarbo - Environmental Solutions and Carbon Projects Ltd.;
This methodology also refers to the latest approved versions of the following tools:
• 	Tool to calculate project or leakage CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion;
• 	Tool to calculate baseline, project and/or leakage emissions from electricity consumption;
• 	Tool to calculate the emission factor for an electricity system;
• 	Tool for the demonstration and assessment of additionality;
• 	Tool to determine project emissions from flaring gases containing methane.
For more information regarding the proposed new methodologies and the tools as well as their
consideration by the Executive Board please refer to <http://cdm.unfccc.int/goto/MPappmeth>.
Selected approach from paragraph 48 of the CDM modalities and procedures
“Emissions from a technology that represents an economically attractive course of action, taking into
account barriers to investment”
Applicability
This methodology applies to project activities where manure is collected by tank trucks, canalized and/or
pumped from multiple livestock farms and the collected material is subsequently treated in a single
central treatment plant. The existing anaerobic manure treatment systems, in the multiple livestock
farms within the project boundary, are replaced by a central treatment plant with one or a combination of
more than one animal waste management systems (AWMSs) that result in less GHG emissions. CERs
may also be claimed from biogas sourced heat/electricity exportations.
The methodology is applicable under the following conditions:
• 	Farms where livestock populations, comprising of cattle, buffalo, swine, sheep, goats, and/or
poultry, are managed under confined conditions;
• 	Farms where manure is not discharged into natural water resources (e.g. rivers or estuaries);
• 	Farms where animal residues are treated under anaerobic conditions;
• 	The annual average temperature in the site where the anaerobic manure treatment facility in the
baseline existed is higher than 5°C;1
1 If monthly average temperature in a particular month is less than 5°C, this month is not included in the estimations,
as it is assumed that no anaerobic activity occurs below such temperature.

• 	In the cases where the baseline anaerobic treatment system is an open lagoon, the lagoon depth
shall be greater than 1 m; 2
• 	The retention time of the organic matter in the baseline anaerobic treatment systems should be at
least 30 days;
• 	If residues are stored in between collection activities, storage tanks shall comprise outdoor open
equipments;
• 	If the treated residue is used as fertilizer in the baseline, project proponents must ensure that this
end use remains the same throughout the project activity;
• 	Sludge produced during the project activity shall be stabilized through thermal drying or
composting, prior to its final disposition/application;
• 	The AWMS/process in the project case should ensure that no leakage of manure waste into
ground water takes place, e.g., the lagoon should have a non-permeable layer at the lagoon
bottom;
• 	CERs shall be claimed by the Central Treatment Plant managing person/entity, only. Other
parties involved must sign a legally binding declaration that they will not claim CERs from the
improved animal waste treatment practices. Such declarations shall be verified by the DOE
during the validation, and these documents shall be valid throughout the whole crediting period.
In addition, the applicability conditions included in the tools referred to above apply.
Finally, this methodology is only applicable if the application of the procedure to identify the baseline
scenario results in that anaerobic manure treatment systems without methane recovery in the farms
are the most plausible baseline scenario.
II. 	BASELINE METHODOLOGY PROCEDURE
Identification of the baseline scenario
Baseline scenario should be identified from the perspective of the owner of central treatment plant, as
well as from the perspective of the multiple livestock farms owners.
Project participants shall apply the following steps to identify the baseline scenario:
Step 1: 	Identify plausible alternative scenarios
(1) 	Identify realistic and credible alternative scenarios that are available to the owner of central
treatment plant, as well as for the multiple livestock farms owners. For the purpose of
identifying relevant alternative scenarios, provide an overview of other technologies or
practices that provide outputs or services with comparable quality, properties and application
areas and that have been implemented previously or are currently underway in the relevant
geographical area. The relevant geographical area should be the at least the action radius of
the regional treatment plant. These alternative scenarios should include, inter alia:
2 In particular, loading in the waste water streams has to be high enough to assure that the lagoon develops an
anaerobic bottom layer and that algal oxygen production can be ruled out.

UNFCCC/CCNUCC
CDM – Executive Board 	AM0073 / Version 01
Sectoral Scope: 13 and 15
EB 44
3/59
For the owner of central treatment plant:
• 	The proposed project activity not being registered as a CDM project activity;
• 	If applicable, continuation of the current situation (no project activity or other alternatives
undertaken).
For the owner of the livestock farms:
• 	The proposed project activity not being registered as a CDM project activity;
• 	All other plausible and credible alternatives to the project activity scenario, including the
common practices in the relevant sector. In doing so, the complete set of possible manure
management systems listed in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas
Inventories (Chapter 10, Table 10.17) should be taken into account. In drawing up a list
of possible scenarios, possible combinations of different Animal Waste Management
Systems (AWMS) should be taken into account;
• 	If applicable, continuation of the current situation.
(2) 	The alternative(s) shall be in compliance with all mandatory applicable legal and regulatory
requirements (this sub-step does not consider national and local policies that do not have
legally-binding status). If an alternative does not comply with all mandatory applicable
legislation and regulations, then show that, based on an examination of current practice in the
region in which the mandatory law or regulation applies, those applicable mandatory legal or
regulatory requirements are systematically not enforced and that non-compliance with those
requirements is widespread in the country. If this cannot be shown, then eliminate the
alternative from further consideration. Apply Sub-step 1b of the latest version of the “Tool for
demonstration assessment and of additionality”.
The identification of all reasonable potential alternative scenarios shall be made through interviews and/or
surveys with each farm owner to assess the technology for manure management that would be
implemented in the farm in the absence of the project activity. The objective of the interviews/surveys is
to collect information to evaluate for each farm owner the likeliness of implementation of the different
possible alternative scenarios. From the information collected, it should be possible to identify the
barriers that may prevent the implementation of alternative technologies, and when needed to perform the
correspondent economic analysis.
For the purpose of identifying alternative scenarios, provide an analysis of other manure management
practices implemented previously or currently underway. Projects are considered similar if they are in the
same country/region, are of a similar scale, and take place in a comparable environment with respect to
regulatory framework, investment climate, access to technology, access to financing, etc. Other CDM
project activities are not to be included in this analysis. Provide documented evidence. On the basis of
that analysis, identify and include all alternative scenarios that are common practice.
Step 2: 	Barrier analysis
This step serves to identify barriers and to assess which alternatives are prevented by these barriers.
Apply the following sub-steps:
Sub-step 2.a. Identify barriers that would prevent the implementation of alternative scenarios
Establish a complete list of realistic and credible barriers that may prevent alternative scenarios to occur.

-- 3 of 59 --

UNFCCC/CCNUCC
CDM – Executive Board 	AM0073 / Version 01
Sectoral Scope: 13 and 15
EB 44
4/59
Such realistic and credible barriers may include:
• 	Investment barriers, other than insufficient financial returns as analyzed in Step 3, inter alia:
o 	For alternatives undertaken and operated by private entities: Similar activities have only
been implemented with grants or other non-commercial finance terms. Similar activities are
defined as activities that rely on a broadly similar technology or practices, are of a similar
scale, take place in a comparable environment with respect to regulatory framework and are
undertaken in the relevant geographical area, as defined in Step 1 above;
o 	No private capital is available from domestic or international capital markets due to real or
perceived risks associated with investments in the country where the project activity is to be
implemented, as demonstrated by the credit rating of the country or other country investment
reports of reputed origin.
• 	Technological barriers, inter alia:
o 	Lack of infrastructure for implementation and logistics for maintenance of the technology;
o 	Risk of technological failure: the process/technology failure risk in the local circumstances is
significantly greater than for other technologies that provide services or outputs comparable
to those of the proposed CDM project activity, as demonstrated by relevant scientific
literature or technology manufacturer information;
o 	The particular technology used in the proposed project activity is not available in the
relevant geographical area.
• 	Barriers due to prevailing practice, inter alia:
o 	The alternative is the “first of its kind”: No alternative of this type is currently operational in
the host country or region.
Sub-step 2.b. Eliminate alternative scenarios which are prevented by the identified barriers
Identify which alternative scenarios are prevented by at least one of the barriers listed above, and
eliminate those alternative scenarios from further consideration. All alternative scenarios shall be
compared to the same set of barriers. The assessment of the significance of barriers should take into
account the level of access to and availability of information, technologies and skilled labor in the specific
context of the sites.
In applying Sub-steps 2.a and 2.b, provide transparent and documented evidence, and offer conservative
interpretations of this evidence, as to how it demonstrates the existence and significance of the identified
barriers and whether alternative scenarios are prevented by these barriers. The type of evidence to be
provided should include at least one of the following:
• 	Relevant legislation, regulatory information or industry norms;
• 	Relevant (sectoral) studies or surveys (e.g. market surveys, technology studies, etc) undertaken by
universities, research institutions, industry associations, companies, bilateral/multilateral
institutions, etc;
• 	Relevant statistical data from national or international statistics;
• 	Documentation of relevant market data (e.g. market prices, tariffs, rules);

UNFCCC/CCNUCC

• 	Written documentation from the companies or institutions from which animal waste will be
collected, such as minutes from Board meetings, correspondence, feasibility studies, financial or
budgetary information, etc;
• 	Written documentation of independent expert judgments from industry, educational institutions
(e.g. universities, technical schools and training centers), industry associations and others.
If there is only one scenario alternative that is not prevented by any barrier, and
(i) If this alternative is not the proposed project activity not being registered as a CDM project
activity, then this scenario alternative is the most plausible baseline scenario;
(ii) If this alternative is the proposed project activity not being registered as a CDM project activity,
then the project activity is the most plausible baseline scenario;
If there are still several baseline scenario alternatives remaining, either go to Step 3 (investment
analysis) or choose the alternative with the lowest emissions (i.e. the most conservative) as the most
plausible baseline scenario.
Step 3: 	Investment analysis
This Step 3 serves to determine which of the alternative scenarios in the short list remaining after Step 2
is the most economically or financially attractive. For this purpose, an investment comparison analysis is
conducted for the remaining alternative scenarios after Step 2. If the investment analysis is conclusive,
the economically or financially most attractive alternative scenario is considered as the baseline scenario.
For each alternative, all costs and economic benefits attributable to the waste management scenario
should be illustrated in a transparent and complete manner, as shown in Table 1 below.

EB 44
6/59
For each alternative baseline scenario, the internal rate of return (IRR) and/or the net present value (NPV)
should be calculated. The calculation of the IRR must include inter alia investment costs, operation and
maintenance costs, as well as any other appropriate costs (engineering, consultancy, etc.). Similarly, take
into consideration all revenues generated by each manure management scenario, including revenue from
the sale of electricity and cost savings due to avoided electricity purchases and other sources of income
related to the implementation of the project, except revenues from the sale of CERs.
The IRR for all alternative scenarios should be calculated in a conservative manner. To ensure this,
assumptions and parameters for the proposed project activity, if still under consideration, should be
chosen in a conservative way such that they tend to lead to a higher IRR and NPV. For all other scenarios
considered, assumptions and parameters should be chosen in a way such that they tend to lead to a lower
IRR and NPV. This conservative choice of parameters and assumptions should be ensured by obtaining
expert opinions and should be evaluated by the DOE as part of the validation of the project activity.
If the IRR cannot be calculated due to the existence of only negative flows in the financial analysis, the
comparison should be based on the NPV, stating explicitly the discount rate used.
Include a sensitivity analysis to assess whether the conclusion regarding the financial attractiveness is
robust to reasonable variations in the critical assumptions.
The baseline scenario is identified as the economically most attractive course of action i.e., alternative
scenario with highest IRR or NPV, where the IRR cannot be calculated
Step 4: 	Baseline revision at renewal of crediting period
At the renewal of each crediting period, the relevance of baseline scenario identified above will be
assessed taking into account change in the relevant national and/or sectoral regulations between two
crediting periods as well as any increase in the animal stock above the pre-project animal stock. This
assessment will be undertaken by the verifying DOE.
This methodology is only applicable if the application of the procedure to identify the baseline scenario
results in that anaerobic manure treatment systems in the farms and no implementation of the central
plant are the most plausible baseline scenario.
Guidance for the assessment of the baseline scenario for the livestock farms
For validation, project proponents shall calculate the baseline emission from each farm separately, based
on ex ante estimation of parameters. Then, project participants shall ordinate, in decreasing order, the
sites where most of the baseline emissions would occur. DOEs shall perform site inspections on the sites
that are individually responsible for an amount of baseline emissions equal to, or higher than, 900 tCO2e
(“upper rank”). This guarantees that the most preponderant baseline GHG sources are properly validated.
For the remaining sites (“lower rank”), DOEs shall perform site inspections on a number n of randomly
selected farms, being n determined as:
2
1 	NE
N
n +
= 	(1)
Where:
n 	= Number of farms to be visited by DOE
N 	= Total number of farms
E 	= Tolerable sampling error (10%).

Sectoral Scope: 13 and 15
EB 44
7/59
If when performing the site inspections on the n randomly selected farms, one of the farms does not
have an anaerobic manure treatment system without methane recovery, then all the farms “lower
rank”should be inspected.
Additionality
The additionality is determined from the perspective of the central treatment plant owner only, being the
livestock farms owners excluded from this analysis. The additionality of the project activity shall be
demonstrated and assessed using the latest version of the “Tool for the demonstration and assessment of
additionality”.
Further guidance on barrier analysis is provided for the identification of the baseline scenario in the above
section. When doing the investment analysis the following potential income sources should be taken into
account: revenues from electricity sales; revenues from heat exportation; revenues from fertilizer sales;
revenues from the treatment service provision (e.g. USD per quantity of treated residues); etc.
Project boundary
The spatial extent of the project boundary encompasses:
• 	The central treatment plant;
• 	The livestock farms;
• 	The site of the biogas combustion or energy generation facility (if existent);
• 	The manure storage tanks;
• 	The road itineraries and/or piping system between the manure collection points and the central
treatment plant.
The greenhouse gases included in or excluded from the project boundary are shown in Table 2.

The project proponents will provide a clear diagrammatic representation of the project scenario with all
the treatments steps adopted in treating the manure waste as well as its final disposal in the CDM-PDD.
The diagrammatic representation will also indicate the fraction of volatile solids degraded within the
project boundary in pre-project situation before disposal. This shall include the final disposal of methane,
if any captured, and also the auxiliary energy used to run project treatments steps.

The precise location of the farms where the project activity takes place shall be identified in the
CDM-PDD (e.g., co-ordinates of farms using global positioning system).
Project emissions
The project activity might include one or a combination of technologies to treat manure. For example, the
effluent mix might be first treated in an anaerobic digester/reactor and then treated waste might be further
processed using an aerobic pond. Each processing step is referred to as a treatment stage.
Project emissions are estimated as follows:

IPCC guidelines specify physical leakage from anaerobic digesters as being 15% of total biogas
production. Where project participants use lower values for percentage of physical leakage, they should
provide measurements or other source of evidence proving that this lower value is appropriate for the
project.
Ex ante leakage to be reported in the CDM-PDD will be estimated using equation 3 or 4 below, with a
leakage factor of 0.15 or a lower value, if properly justified through documented evidence (which should
be validated by the DOE).

For subsequent treatment stages, the reduction of the nitrogen during a treatment stage is estimated based
on referenced data for different treatment types. Emissions from the next treatment stage are then
calculated following the approach outlined above, but with nitrogen adjusted for the reduction from the
previous treatment stages by multiplying by (1-RN), where RN is the relative reduction of nitrogen from
the previous stage. The relative reduction (R N) of nitrogen depends on the treatment technology and
should be estimated in a conservative manner. Default values for different treatment technologies can be
found in Chapter 8.2 in US-EPA (2001).6 These values are provided in Annex 1. Else, RN can be
calculated based on the direct monitoring of the nitrogen concentration in the effluent mix after each
treatment step.
(iv) Physical Leakage from distribution network of the captured methane in (PEPL)
This refers to leaks in the biogas system from the biogas pipeline delivery system. The sum of the
quantities of captured methane fed to the flare, to the power plant and to the boiler (measured as per the
monitoring plan) must be compared annually with the total methane generated as measured by meter at
the outlet of the methane generating digester. The difference between the monitored value of methane
generated and that consumed in flare/electricity generation/heat shall be accounted as leakage from the
pipelines.
In the case where biogas is just flared and the pipeline from collection point to flare is short (i.e., less than
1 km, and for on site delivery only), one flow meter can be used. In such cases the physical leakage may
be considered as zero.
(v) Project emissions from flaring of the residual gas stream ( 	y	flare	PE 	, )
The combustion of biogas methane may give rise to significant methane emissions as a result of
incomplete or inefficient combustion.
Project emissions from flaring of the residual gas stream should be determined following the procedure
described in the “Tool to determine project emissions from flaring gases containing Methane”.
(vi) Project emissions from heat use and electricity use (PEelec/heat):

emissions from electricity consumption”. In case, the electricity consumption is
not measured then the electricity consumption shall be estimated as follows:

Emissions arising form the road transportation of treated manure shall be calculated as described above.
Such emission shall be considered as project emissions if the final destiny and itinerary between the
treatment plant are included in the project boundary. Otherwise such emission shall be considered as
leakage ( 	y	Trans	CO	LE 	,	,2 ), which shall be calculated in the same manner as depicted above.
In the cases tank trucks are used to collect residues, there may be the need to temporarily store them in
storage tanks in between collection procedures interval. This methodology only covers those situations in
which residues are stored in outdoor open storage tanks. If project participants wish to use a different
storage technology they are encouraged to proposed amendments to this methodology. Methane project
emissions may occur during residues storage and shall be calculated as follows:

(C) Methane conversion factors ( 	j	MCF ):
• 	The IPCC 2006 MCF values given in table 10.17 (chapter 10, volume 4) should be used, which is
attached here as Annex 4. MCF values depend on the annual average temperature where the
anaerobic manure treatment facility in the baseline existed. For average annual temperatures
below 10ºC and above 5ºC, a linear interpolation should be used to estimate the MCF value at the
specific temperature assuming an MCF value of 0 at an annual average of 5ºC. Future revisions
to the IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories should be taken into account;
• 	A conservativeness factor should be applied by multiplying MCF values (estimated as per above
bullet) with a value of 0.94, to account for the 20% uncertainty in the MCF values as reported by
IPCC 2006.
For subsequent treatment stages, the reduction of the volatile solids during a treatment stage is estimated
based on referenced data for different treatment types. Emissions from the next treatment stage are then
calculated following the approach outlined above, but with volatile solids adjusted for the reduction from
the previous treatment stages by multiplying by (1 - RVS), where R VS is the relative reduction of volatile
solids from the previous stage. The relative reduction (R VS) of volatile solids depends on the treatment
technology and should be estimated in a conservative manner. Default values for different treatment
technologies can be found in Table 8.10 of chapter 8.2 in US-EPA (2001)11. These values are provided in

For subsequent treatment stages, the reduction of the nitrogen during a treatment stage is estimated based
on referenced data for different treatment types. Emissions from the next treatment stage are then
calculated following the approach outlined above, but with nitrogen adjusted for the reduction from the
previous treatment stages by multiplying by (1 - R N), where R N is the relative reduction of nitrogen from
the previous stage. The relative reduction (R N) of nitrogen depends on the treatment technology and
should be estimated in a conservative manner. Default values for different treatment technologies can be
found in Chapter 8.2 in USEPA (2001). 12 These values are provided in Annex 1.

Determination of CEF Bl,elec:
• 	In cases where electricity would in the absence of the project activity be generated in an on-site
fossil fuel fired power plant, project participants should use for CEF Bl,elec, the default emission
factor for a diesel generator with a capacity of more than 200 kW for small-scale project activities
(0.8 tCO2 /MWh, see Table I.D.1 in the simplified baseline and monitoring methodology AMS.I.D
for selected small-scale CDM project activity categories);
• 	In cases where electricity would, in the absence of the project activity, be purchased from the
grid, the emission factor CEF Bl,elec should be calculated according to the latest version of the
“Tool to calculate project emissions from electricity consumption”. If electricity consumption is
less than small-scale threshold (60 GWh/yr), use the default emission factor for a diesel generator
with a capacity of more than 200 kW for small-scale project activities (0.8 tCO2 /MWh, see
Table I.D.1 in the simplified baseline and monitoring methodology AMS.I.D for selected
small-scale CDM project activity categories).
Determination of CEF grid:
CEF grid should be calculated according to “Tool to calculate the emission factor for an electricity

Determination of CEF Bl,therm:
CEF Bl,therm is the CO2 emissions intensity for thermal energy generation (tCO2 e/MJ).
Baseline electricity and thermal energy consumptions should be estimated as the average of the historical
3 years consumption.
Leakage
Leakage covers the emissions from land application of treated residues, outside the project boundary.
These emissions are estimated as net of those released under project activity and those released in the
baseline scenario. Net leakage of N2 O and CH4 are only considered if they are positive. CO2 emissions
due to the road transportation of sludge or treated effluent outside the project boundary are also
considered as leakage. Such emissions are calculated in the same as depicted in the project emissions
section.

CH4 emissions from the baseline are higher than the measured CH4 generated in the anaerobic digester in
the project situation (this is calculated as product of biogas flow at the digester outlet and methane
fraction in the biogas), then the latter shall be used to calculate the emissions reduction for claiming
certified emissions reductions. Therefore, the actual methane captured from an anaerobic digester/reactor
shall be compared to the ( 	y	PL	y	AD	y	CH 	PE	PE	BE 	,	,	,4 	−	− ) and if found lower, then
( 	y	PL	y	AD	y	CH 	PE	PE	BE 	,	,	,4 	−	− ) (which is a component of 	y	y 	PE	BE 	− ) in equation 39 is replaced by actual

In order to ensure that the animal wastes entering the central treatment plant are indeed originated from
the sites included in the project boundary, it must be ensured that:
(1) 	In the case where residues are collected with tank trucks, those must be equipped with flow
meters and GPS devices. For every charging and discharging operation a geo-reference must be
acquired, and the quantity of residues collected should be measured (m3 ). This information will
also be used for DOEs to check the periodicity of the manure collection activities;
(2) 	In the cases where residues are led to the central treatment plant though pipes, the piping system
shall be detailed in the CDM-PDD. The quantity of residues collected through the pipes system
should be measured (m3 ). It shall be depicted in the CDM-PDD whether the residues are
continuously directed to the central treatment plant or not.
The precise location of manure collection points shall be identified in the CDM-PDD (e.g., coordinates
using global positioning system) and the road distances of the itineraries between them and the manure
central treatment plant shall be documented using information from official sources.
DOEs must perform site visits on the central treatment plant during project verification. All
documentation which shall be checked by the DOE, referring to every farm, must be available during the
verification (sales records, feed formulation, etc.). However, DOEs are not requested to perform site
visits in all farms included in the project boundary. Instead the DOEs and project participants may
proceed as described in the following section.

Prior to the verification, project proponents shall calculate the baseline emission from each site
separately. Then, project participants shall ordinate, in decreasing order, the sites where most of the
baseline emissions would occur. DOEs shall perform site inspections on the sites that are individually
responsible for an amount of baseline emissions equal or higher than 900 tCO2e (“upper rank”). This
guarantees that the most preponderant baseline GHG sources are properly verified. For the remaining
sites (“lower rank”), 	DOEs shall perform site inspections on a number n of randomly selected sites,
being n determined as:

Characteristics. Page 2.
Definitions
• 	Total Solids: Residue remaining after water is removed from waste material by evaporation; dry
matter;
• 	Volatile Solids: The part of total solids driven off as volatile (combustible) gases when heated to
600ºC; organic matter;
• 	Fixed Solids: The part of total solids remaining after volatile gases driven off at 600ºC; ashes.
Determination method
1 - Evaporate free water on steam able and dry in oven at 103°C for 24 hours or until constant weight to
obtain the Total Solids.
2 - Place Total Solids residue in furnace at 600ºC for at least 1 hour. Volatile Solids are determined from
weight difference of total and Fixed Solids.

Annex 3: Determination of Total Nitrogen in animal waste
Definitions
• 	Ammoniacal nitrogen (total ammonia): Both NH3 and NH4 nitrogen compounds;
• 	Ammonia nitrogen: A gaseous form of ammoniacal nitrogen;
• 	Ammonium nitrogen: The positively ionized (cation) form of ammoniacal nitrogen;
• 	Total Kjeldahl nitrogen: The sum of organic nitrogen and ammoniacal nitrogen;
• 	Nitrate nitrogen: The negatively ionized (anion) form of nitrogen that is highly mobile;
• 	Total nitrogen: The summation of nitrogen from all the various nitrogen compounds listed above.
Principles and guidelines for Total Nitrogen Determination
Total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) can be an accurate predictor of total N content, because the inorganic N
content in manure generally is very small when compared to the total N content (Paul and Beauchamp,
1993; Eghball, 2000).
Total Kjeldahl nitrogen is a wet oxidation procedure used to determine the organic N present as NH3 in
soils, plants and organic residues, such as manure. The three main steps of the Kjeldahl method are:
(1) digestion, (2) separation of ammonia, and (3) determination of ammonia. In some techniques the
separation stage is omitted and the ammonia is determined directly on the digest. Separation of ammonia
may be effected by steam distillation, aeration, or diffusion, steam distillation being conventional. With
automated procedures this separation step is invariably omitted (Fleck, 1969).
The determination of ammonia may be by: (1) simple titration, (2) iodometric methods, (3) coulometric
methods or (4) colorimetric methods. Without separation of ammonia from the digest simple titration
cannot be utilized (Fleck, 1969).
The remaining three techniques can, however, be applied directly to the digest. Iodometric and analogous
methods have disadvantages (McKenzie & Wallace, 1954 APUD Fleck, 1969) and are not popular.
Coulometric methods are not widely applied. Colorimetry remains as the only well-tried approach for
automation (Fleck, 1969).
The three popular colorimetric methods of NH3 , determination are: ninhydrin, Nessler, and the phenol-
hypochlorite or Berthelot reaction. The ninhydrin method has been successfully applied following
sealed-tube digestion (Jacobs, 1965 APUD Fleck, 1969). The Nessler method, although excellent for
simple aqueous ammonia solutions, is not advisable when ammonia is to be determined in Kjeldahl
digestion mixtures (Fleck & Munro, 1965 APUD Fleck, 1969).
The most important aspect of the Kjeldahl method is digestion, which may be carried out in an open tube
or in a sealed tube. The critical factors are: (I) temperature,(2)catalyst, (3) time, (4) reflux and
(5) decomposition of the ammonia-catalyst complex. The optimum temperature for sealed-tube digestion
is in the region of 450ºC and the main advantage is that no catalyst or other additions are required.
The more commonly utilized open-tube digestion requires a temperature close to 400°C for adequate
decomposition of nitrogenous compounds to ammonia. The evidence for this is clear (Bradstreet, 1965;
Fleck & Munro, 1965 APUD Fleck, 1969), as is the evidence that the only satisfactory means of attaining
this temperature is to add the appropriate amounts of K2 SO4 . When the temperature exceeds 400°C the
digest solidifies on cooling (Bradstreet, 1957 APUD Fleck, 1969). This is an important practical point
because temperatures in excess of 400ºC lead to loss of nitrogen (as well as loss of acid which leads to the
solid cold digest).

With regard to the catalyst, mercury is indicated as the only 'safe' catalyst, with which no losses have been
reported (Bradstreet, 1965; Fleck & Munro, 1965APUD Fleck, 1969). The disadvantage of mercury is
that it forms a mercury-ammonium complex which must be decomposed before determining ammonia.
This decomposition may be achieved by using sodium thiosulphate or zinc dust (Fleck, 1969).
The use of oxidizing can cause loss of nitrogen (Peters & Van Slyke, 1932). There the use of such agents
is not recommended for the purposes of the project activities employing this methodology.
For manual determination PPs shall follow the protocol depicted below (adapted from Mendham
et al., 2002):
1 – Homogenize manure sample through intense agitation;
2 – Before sample precipitates pipette a certain volume (a mL) which contains approximately 0.04 g of
nitrogen (based on previous experience) and transfer it to a long-necked Kjeldahl digestion tube;
3 – Add 0.7 g mercury oxide (II), 15 gof potassium sulfate and 40 mL of concentrated sulfuric acid;
4 –Gently heat the digestion tube, keeping it slightly tilted. Frothing may occur. If needed frothing may
be controlled through the use of anti-frothing agents;
5 –Once frothing ceases, boil reagents during 2 hours;
6 – After cooling add 200 mL of water and 25 mL of sodium thiosulphate solution (0.5 M). Perform this
step under agitation;
7 – Add a few glass beads to the mixture;
8 –Carefully introduce in the digestion tube a sodium hydroxide solution (11 M). Before mixing the
reagents, connect the digestion tube to a distillation apparatus (see figure below). Keep the outlet of the
condenser immersed into a known volume of 0.1 M HCl solution. Be certain that the contents of the
digestion tube are well mixed;
9 –Boil until the 150 mL of the distilled liquid has been collected in the receptor tube;
10 – Add indicator Methyl Red to the receptor tube. Titrate with 0.1 M NaCl (b mL). Titrate a blank
using the same volume of 0.1 M HCl (c mL).
With the quantities and concentrations of reagents provided above, the nitrogen concentration in the
sample (kg N/m3 ) is given as follows:

Annex 4: Guidance on sample extraction and statistical procedures
For the purposes of the essays described in Annex 2 and 3, project participants shall observe the
following guidance on sample extraction procedure:
1 – For liquid material, samples should be preferably collected using continuous-flow samples at the
entrance or exit point of the pertinent treatment stage;
2 - Samples should be collected in clean wide-mouth glass bottles;
3 – Samples should be analysed as soon as possible. If samples need to be stored, storage shall be
performed at 4ºC;
4 - It should be checked that the suspended matter does not adhere to the walls, prior to the analysis
procedure;
5 – If results must be expressed in a dry matter basis, dry matter content shall be determined after oven-
drying at 103°C for 24 hours or until constant weight is obtained;
6 - Uncertainty range shall not exceed 20% under a 90% confidence interval, which is calculated as
depicted in the formula below:
