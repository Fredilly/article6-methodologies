This requires the most infrastructure and cost but is likely to provide a more accurate calculation of actual emissions. Refer to appendix 3 for reference. Project proponents may refer to existing literature on model validation for the specific project area and crops used in baseline as well as project scenarios. Model validation through literature reference is only applicable if project proponents are able to demonstrate that the studies referred to have used the updated version of the model and have validated application for the same set of conditions/parameters of where crop is grown in the project activity. A literature review of DNDC model validations is provided in appendix 2 for reference. Alternatively, project proponents may wish to undertake a model validation study prior to project implementation. Model validation must be carried out for the baseline crop and area parameters as well as the NUE crop and parameters in the project scenario. Project proponents can follow methodologies provided in model validation studies available the University of New Hampshire website <http://www.dndc.sr.unh.edu/>. The DNDC model requires inputs of various soil characteristics like texture, density and soil organic carbon content as well as inputs of crop characteristics like tillage, fertilization and irrigation. These input data are required for the project site. Since the project activity is based on the use of NUE seed the only parameters that could change are the fertilizer requirements and crop characteristics of the alternative seed.",
