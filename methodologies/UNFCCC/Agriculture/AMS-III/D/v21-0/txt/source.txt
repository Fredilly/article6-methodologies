1. Introduction
1. The following table describes the key elements of the methodology:
Table 1. Methodology key elements
Typical projects Replacement or modification of existing anaerobic manure
management systems in livestock farms, or treatment of
manure collected from several farms in a centralized plant to
achieve methane recovery and destruction by
flaring/combustion or energetic use of the recovered methane
Type of GHG emissions
mitigation action
GHG destruction:
GHG destruction and displacement of more- GHG -intensive

2. Scope, applicability, and entry into force
2.1. Scope
2. This methodology covers project activities involving the replacement or modification of
anaerobic animal manure management systems in livestock farms to achieve methane
recovery and destruction by flaring/combustion or gainful use of the recovered methane.
It also covers treatment of manure collected from several farms in a centralized plant.
2.2. Applicability
3. This methodology is only applicable under the following conditions:
(a) The livestock population in the farm is managed under confined conditions;
(b) Manure or the streams obtained after treatment are not discharged into natural
water resources (e.g. river or estuaries), otherwise “AMS-III.H Methane recovery
in wastewater treatment" shall be applied;
(c) The annual average temperature of baseline site where anaerobic manure
treatment facility is located is higher than 5°C;
(d) In the baseline scenario the retention time of manure waste in the anaerobic
treatment system is greater than one month, and if anaerobic lagoons are used in
the baseline, their depths are at least 1 m;
(e) No methane recovery and destruction by flaring or combustion for gainful use takes
place in the baseline scenario.
4. The project activity shall satisfy the following conditions:
(a) The residual waste from the animal manure management system shall be handled
aerobically, otherwise the related emissions shall be taken into account as per
relevant procedures of “AMS-III.AO Methane recovery through controlled
anaerobic digestion". In the case of soil application, proper conditions and
procedures (not resulting in methane emissions) must be ensured;

(b) Technical measures shall be used (including a flare for exigencies) to ensure that
all biogas produced by the digester is used or flared;
(c) The storage time of the manure after removal from the animal barns, including
transportation, should not exceed 45 days before being fed into the anaerobic
digester. If the project proponent can demonstrate that the dry matter content of
the manure when removed from the animal barns is larger than 20%, this time
constraint will not apply.

organic matters shall use the methodology “AMS-III.AO Methane recovery through
controlled anaerobic digestion".
6. Utilization of the recovered biogas in one of the options detailed in AMS-III.H is also eligible
under this methodology. The respective procedures in AMS-III.H shall be followed in this
regard. If the recovered biogas is used to power auxiliary equipment of the project activity,
it should be taken into account accordingly, using zero as its emission factor; however,
energy used for such purposes is not eligible as an SSC CDM Type I project component.
7. New facilities (Greenfield projects) and project activities involving capacity additions
compared to the baseline scenario are only eligible if they comply with the related and
relevant requirements in the "General guidelines for SSC CDM methodologies".
8. The requirements concerning demonstration of the remaining lifetime of the replaced
equipment shall be met as described in the "General guidelines for SSC CDM
methodologies".
9. Measures are limited to those that result in aggregate emission reductions of less than or
equal to 60 kt CO2 equivalent annually from all Type III components of the project activity.
2.3. Entry into force
10. The Month of entry into force is the date of the publication of the EB 96 meeting report on
22 September 2017.
2.4. Applicability of sectoral scopes
11. For validation and verification of CDM projects and programme of activities by a
designated operational entity (DOE) using this methodology, application of sectoral scope
13 is mandatory.
3. Normative references
12. Project participants shall take into account the “General guidelines for SSC CDM
methodologies” and the “Guidelines on the demonstration of additionality of small-scale
project activities” (Attachment A to Appendix B) provided at:
<http://cdm.unfccc.int/methodologies/SSCmethodologies/approved.html> mutatis

consumption”;
(j) “Tool to calculate project or leakage CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion”.
4. Baseline methodology
4.1. Project boundary
14. The project boundary includes the physical, geographical site(s) of:
(a) The livestock;
(b) Animal manure management systems (including centralised manure treatment
plant where applicable);
(c) Facilities which recover and flare/combust or use methane.
4.2. Additionality
15. Project activities may demonstrate the additionality by showing that there is no regulation
in the host country, applicable to the project site, that requires the collection and
destruction of methane from livestock manure. If so, it is not required to apply the
“Guidelines on the demonstration of additionality of small-scale project activities”.
16. This additionality condition also applies to Greenfield project activities. Furthermore, for
project activities applying this methodology in combination with a Type I methodology, that
has an energy component whose installed capacity is less than 5 MW, this procedure for
additionality demonstration also applies to that component.
4.3. Baseline emissions
17. The baseline scenario is the situation where, in the absence of the project activity, animal
manure is left to decay anaerobically within the project boundary and methane is emitted
to the atmosphere. Baseline emissions (BEy) are calculated by using one of the following
two options:
(a) Using the amount of the waste or raw material that would decay anaerobically in
the absence of the project activity, with the most recent IPCC Tier 2 approach
(please refer to the chapter ‘Emissions from Livestock and Manure Management’
under the volume ‘Agriculture, Forestry and other Land use’ of the 2006 IPCC
Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories). For this calculation,
information about the characteristics of the manure and of the management
systems in the baseline is required. Manure characteristics include the amount of
volatile solids (VS) produced by the livestock and the maximum amount of methane
that can be potentially produced from that manure (Bo);

AMS-III.D.
Small-scale Methodology: Methane recovery in animal manure management systems
Version 21.0
Sectoral scope(s): 13
7 of 30
(b) Using the amount of manure that would decay anaerobically in the absence of the
project activity based on direct measurement of the quantity of manure treated
together with its specific volatile solids (SVS) content.
18. If option in paragraph 17(a) is chosen, baseline emissions are determined as follows:
𝐵𝐸𝑦 = 𝐺𝑊𝑃𝐶𝐻4 × 𝐷𝐶𝐻4 × 𝑈𝐹𝑏 ×LT	j, 𝑀𝐶𝐹𝑗 × 𝐵0,𝐿𝑇 × 𝑁𝐿𝑇,𝑦 × 𝑉𝑆𝐿𝑇,𝑦 ×
𝑀𝑆%𝐵𝑙,𝑗
Equation (1)
Where:
𝐵𝐸𝑦 = Baseline emissions in year y (t CO2e)
𝐺𝑊𝑃𝐶𝐻4 = Global Warming Potential (GWP) of CH4 applicable to the crediting period
(t CO2e/t CH4)
𝐷𝐶𝐻4 = CH4 density (0.00067 t/m3 at room temperature (20 ºC) and 1 atm
pressure)
𝐿𝑇 = Index for all types of livestock
𝑗 = Index for animal manure management system
𝑀𝐶𝐹𝑗 = Annual methane conversion factor (MCF) for the baseline animal manure
management systemj
𝐵0,𝐿𝑇 = Maximum methane producing potential of the volatile solid generated for
animal type LT (m3 CH4/kg-dm)
𝑁𝐿𝑇,𝑦 = Annual average number of animals of type LT in year y (numbers)
𝑉𝑆𝐿𝑇,𝑦 = Volatile solids production/excretion per animal of livestock LT in year y
(on a dry matter weight basis, kg-dm/animal/year)
𝑀𝑆%𝐵𝑙,𝑗 = Fraction of manure handled in baseline animal manure management
system j
𝑈𝐹𝑏 = Model correction factor to account for model uncertainties (0.94)1
(a) The maximum methane-producing capacity of the manure (Bo) varies by species
and diet. The preferred method to obtain Bo measurement values is to use data
from country-specific published sources, measured with a standardised method
(Bo shall be based on total as-excreted VS). These values shall be compared to
IPCC default values and any significant differences shall be explained. If country
specific Bo values are not available, default values from tables 10 A-4 to 10 A-9 of
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories volume 4
Chapter 10 can be used, provided that the project participants assess the suitability
of those data to the specific situation of the treatment site;
(b) VS are the organic material in livestock manure and consist of both biodegradable
and non-biodegradable fractions. For the calculations the total VS excreted by
each animal species is required.

(i) The preferred method to obtain VS is to use data from nationally published
sources. These values shall be compared with IPCC default values and any
significant differences shall be explained.
(ii) If data from nationally published sources are not available, country-specific
VS excretion rates can be estimated from feed intake levels, via the
enhanced characterisation method (tier 2) described in section 10.2 in 2006
IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories Volume 4 chapter
10, using the equation (2) below.
𝑉𝑆𝐿𝑇,𝑦 = [𝐺𝐸𝐿𝑇 × (1 − 𝐷𝐸𝐿𝑇
100 ) + (𝑈𝐸 × 𝐺𝐸𝐿𝑇)] × [(1 − 𝐴𝑆𝐻
𝐸𝐷𝐿𝑇
)] × 𝑛𝑑𝑦
Equation (2)
Where:
𝑉𝑆𝐿𝑇,𝑦 = Annual volatile solid excretions for livestock LT entering all animal
waste management systems on a dry matter weight basis (kg-
dm/animal/yr)
𝐺𝐸𝐿𝑇 = Daily average gross energy intake (MJ/animal/day)
𝐷𝐸𝐿𝑇 = Digestible energy of the feed (per cent)
𝑈𝐸 = Urinary energy (fraction of GELT)
𝐴𝑆𝐻 = Ash content of manure (fraction of the dry matter feed intake)
𝐸𝐷𝐿𝑇 = Energy density of the feed fed to livestock type LT (MJ/kg-dm)
𝑛𝑑𝑦 = Number of days treatment plant was operational in year y
(iii) If country specific VS values are not available IPCC default values from 2006
IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories Volume 4 chapter
10 table 10 A-4 to 10 A-9 can be used provided that the project participants
assess the suitability of those data to the specific situation of the treatment
site particularly with reference to feed intake levels;
(c) Project participants may adjust default IPCC values for VS for a site-specific
average animal weight. If so, it shall be well explained and documented. The
following equation shall be used:
𝑉𝑆𝐿𝑇,𝑦 = ( 𝑊𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑒
𝑊𝑑𝑒𝑓𝑎𝑢𝑙𝑡
) × 𝑉𝑆𝑑𝑒𝑓𝑎𝑢𝑙𝑡 × 𝑛𝑑𝑦
Equation (3)
Where:
𝑊𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑒 = Average animal weight of a defined livestock population at the project
site (kg)
𝑊𝑑𝑒𝑓𝑎𝑢𝑙𝑡 = Default average animal weight of a defined population, this data is
sourced from IPCC 2006 (kg)
𝑉𝑆𝑑𝑒𝑓𝑎𝑢𝑙𝑡 = Default value for the volatile solid excretion rate per day on a dry-matter
basis for a defined livestock population (kg-dm/animal/day)

𝑛𝑑𝑦 = Number of days treatment plant was operational in year y
(d) Bo or VS values applicable to developed countries can be used provided the
following four conditions are satisfied:
(i) The genetic source of the livestock originates from an Annex I Party;
(ii) The farm uses formulated feed rations (FFR) which are optimized for the
various animal(s), stage of growth, category, weight gain/productivity and/or
genetics;
(iii) The use of FFR can be validated (through on-farm record keeping, feed
supplier, etc.);
(iv) The project specific animal weights are more similar to developed country
IPCC default values.
(e) In the case of sequential treatment stages, the reduction of the volatile solids during
a treatment stage is estimated based on referenced data for different treatment
types. Emissions from the next treatment stage are then calculated following the
approach outlined above, but with volatile solids adjusted for the reduction from
the previous treatment stages by multiplying by (1 - RVS), where RVS is the
relative reduction of volatile solids from the previous stage. The relative reduction
of volatile solids (RVS) depends on the treatment technology and should be
estimated in a conservative manner. Default values for different treatment
technologies can be found in the table in the Appendix;
(f) Methane Conversion Factors (MCF) values are determined for a specific manure
management system and represent the degree to which Bo is achieved. Where
available country-specific MCF values that reflect the specific management
systems used in particular countries or regions shall be used. Alternatively, the
IPCC default values provided in table 10.17 of 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National
Greenhouse Gas Inventories Volume 4 Chapter 10 can be used. The site annual
average temperature is taken from official data at the nearest meteorological
station, or from data available from historical on site observations;
(g) The annual average number of animals (NLT,y) is determined as follows:
𝑁𝐿𝑇,𝑦 = 𝑁𝑑𝑎,𝑦 × (𝑁𝑝,𝑦
365) Equation (4)
Where:
𝑁𝑑𝑎,𝑦 = Number of days animal is alive in the farm in the year y (numbers)
𝑁𝑝,𝑦 = Number of animals produced annually of type LT for the year y
(numbers)

19. If option in paragraph 17(b) is chosen, baseline emissions are determined based on
directly measured quantity of manure and its specific volatile solids content, as follows:
𝐵𝐸𝑦 = 𝐺𝑊𝑃𝐶𝐻4 × 𝐷𝐶𝐻4 × 𝑈𝐹𝑏 × ∑ 𝑀𝐶𝐹𝑗
𝑗,𝐿𝑇
× 𝐵0,𝐿𝑇 × 𝑄𝑚𝑎𝑛𝑢𝑟𝑒,𝑗,𝐿𝑇,𝑦 × 𝑆𝑉𝑆𝑗,𝐿𝑇,𝑦
Equation (5)
Where:

management system j (tonnes/year, dry basis)

management system j, as per paragraph 18 above
𝐵0,𝐿𝑇 = Maximum methane producing potential of the volatile solid generated for
animal type LT (m3 CH4/kg-dm), as per paragraph 18 above
4.4. Project activity emissions
20. Project activity emissions consist of:
(a) Physical leakage of biogas in the manure management systems which includes
production, collection and transport of biogas to the point of flaring/combustion or
gainful use (PEPL,y);
(b) Emissions from flaring or combustion of the gas stream (PEflare,y);
(c) CO2 emissions from use of fossil fuels or electricity for the operation of all the
installed facilities (PEpower,y);
(d) CO2 emissions from incremental transportation distances;
(e) Emissions from the storage of manure before being fed into the anaerobic digester
(PEstorage,y).

21. Project emissions due to physical leakage of biogas from the animal manure management
systems used to produce, collect and transport the biogas to the point of flaring or gainful
use are estimated as:
(a) 10% of the maximum methane producing potential of the manure fed into the
management systems implemented by the project activity:2
(i) If the option in paragraph 17(a) is chosen, it is determined as:
𝑃𝐸𝑃𝐿,𝑦 = 0.10 × 𝐺𝑊𝑃𝐶𝐻4 × 𝐷𝐶𝐻4 × ∑ 𝐵0,𝐿𝑇 × 𝑁𝐿𝑇,𝑦 × 𝑉𝑆𝐿𝑇,𝑦 × 𝑀𝑆%𝑖,𝑦
𝑖,𝐿𝑇
Equation (7)
Where:
𝑀𝑆%𝑖,𝑦 = Fraction of manure handled in system i in year y
If the project activity involves sequential manure management systems,
the procedure specified in paragraph 18(e) shall be used to estimate the
project emissions due to physical leakage of biogas in each stage
(ii) If the option in paragraph 17(b) is chosen, it is determined as:
𝑃𝐸𝑃𝐿,𝑦 = 0.10 × 𝐺𝑊𝑃𝐶𝐻4 × 𝐷𝐶𝐻4

Equation (8)
(b) Optionally, the relevant procedure in the methodological tool “Project and leakage
emissions from anaerobic digesters” may be followed. In such a case, PEPL,y is
equivalent to PECH4,y in the tool.
22. In the case of flaring of the recovered biogas, project emissions are estimated using the
procedures described in the methodological tool “Project emissions from flaring”. If the
recovered biogas is combusted for electrical/thermal energy production or for other gainful
use, the methane destruction efficiency can be considered as 100%. However, this use of
the recovered biogas shall be included in the project boundary and its output shall be
monitored in order to ensure that the recovered biogas is actually destroyed, even if the
emission reductions from this component are not claimed.
Box 1. Non-binding best practice example 2: Monitoring of energy output as per
paragraph 21
The project activity is to capture methane from manure that would be released to the
atmosphere in the baseline scenario, in a swine farm. The methane is used to generate steam
in a biogas fuelled boiler in an on-site food processing facility. The project participant would
like to consider a methane destruction efficiency of 100% in the boiler. Hence on top of
monitoring the required parameters as described in Section 5 below, the project participant will
also monitor the steam output from the boiler.
2 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories Volume 4 Chapter 10 guidelines specify
a default value of 10% of the maximum methane producing potential (Bo) for the physical leakages from
anaerobic digesters.

23. Project emissions from electricity and fossil fuel consumption are determined by following
the methodological tool “Project and leakage emissions from anaerobic digesters”, where
PEPower,y is the sum of PEEC,y and PEFC,y in the tool.
24. Project emissions on account of storage of manure before being fed into the anaerobic
digester shall be accounted for if both condition (a) and condition (b) below are satisfied:
(a) The storage time of the manure after removal from the animal barns, including
transportation, exceeds 24 hours before being fed into the anaerobic digester;
(b) The dry matter content of the manure when removed from the animal barns is less
than 20%.

× ∑ [365
𝐴𝐼𝑙	
𝐿𝑇,𝑙
× ∑(𝑁𝐿𝑇 × 𝑉𝑆𝐿𝑇,𝑑 × 𝑀𝑆%𝑙 × (1 − 𝑒−𝑘(𝐴𝐼𝑙−𝑑)) × 𝑀𝐶𝐹𝑖

Where:
𝑃𝐸𝑠𝑡𝑜𝑟𝑎𝑔𝑒 = Project emissions on account of manure storage in year y (t CO2e)
𝐴𝐼𝑙 = Annual average interval between manure collection and delivery for
treatment at a given storage device l (days)
𝑉𝑆𝐿𝑇,𝑑 = Amount of volatile solid production by type of animal LT in a day
(kg VS/head/d)
𝑀𝑆%𝑙 = Fraction of volatile solids (%) handled by storage device l
𝑘 = Degradation rate constant (0.069)

can vary from 1 to 45 and to be run from 1 up to AIl

device l from Table 10.17, Chapter 10, Volume 4
4.5. Leakage
26. It is determined by following the relevant procedure in the methodological tool “Project and
leakage emissions from anaerobic digesters”.
4.6. Emission reductions
27. The emission reductions achieved by the project activity will be determined ex post
through direct measurement of the amount of methane fuelled, flared or gainfully used. It

is likely that the project activity involves manure treatment steps with higher methane
conversion factors (MCF) than the MCF for the manure treatment systems used in the
baseline situation, therefore the emission reductions achieved by the project activity are
limited to the ex post calculated baseline emissions minus the project emissions using the
actual monitored data for the project activity (i.e. NLT,y, MS% i,y, MS% l, AIl, as well as VSLT,y
in cases where adjusted values for animal weight are used). The emission reductions
achieved in any year are the lowest value of the following:
𝐸𝑅𝑦,𝑒𝑥 𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡 = 𝑚𝑖𝑛[(𝐵𝐸𝑦,𝑒𝑥 𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡 − 𝑃𝐸𝑦,𝑒𝑥 𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡), (𝑀𝐷𝑦 − 𝑃𝐸𝑝𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑟,𝑦,𝑒𝑥 𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡)] Equation (10)

𝐵𝐸𝑦,𝑒𝑥 𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡 = Baseline emissions calculated using equation 1 (for projects using option
in paragraph 17(a)) using ex post monitored values of NLT,y and if
applicable VSLT,y. For projects using option in paragraph 17(b), the

values of NLT,y,MS% i,y, MS% l, AIl, Qres waste,y and if applicable VSLT,y
𝑀𝐷𝑦 = Methane captured and destroyed or used gainfully by the project activity
in year y (t CO2e)
𝑃𝐸𝑝𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑟,𝑦,𝑒𝑥 𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡 = Emissions from the use of fossil fuel or electricity for the operation of the
installed facilities based on monitored values in the year y (t CO2e)
28. Biogas flared or combusted, (MDy) shall be determined using the flare efficiency and
methane content of biogas.
𝑀𝐷𝑦 = 𝐵𝐺𝑏𝑢𝑟𝑛𝑡,𝑦 × 𝑤𝐶𝐻4,𝑦 × 𝐷𝐶𝐻4 × 𝐹𝐸 × 𝐺𝑊𝑃𝐶𝐻4 Equation (11)
Where:
𝐵𝐺𝑏𝑢𝑟𝑛𝑡,𝑦 = Biogas flared or combusted in year y (m3)
𝑤𝐶𝐻4,𝑦 = Methane content in biogas in the year y (volume fraction)
𝐹𝐸 = Flare efficiency in the year y (fraction)
29. The method for integration of the terms in equation above to obtain the results for one
year of measurements within the confidence level, as well as the methods and instruments
used for metering, recording and processing the data obtained, shall be described in the
project design document and monitored during the crediting period.
30. Alternatively, if project activities utilize the recovered methane for power generation,	y	MD
may be calculated as follows, based on the amount of monitored electricity generation,
without monitoring methane flow and concentration:

𝐸𝐸𝑦y = Energy conversion efficiency of the project equipment, which is
determined by adopting one of the following criteria:

equipment shall be designed to utilize biogas as fuel, and efficiency
specification is for this fuel. If the specification provides a range of
efficiency values, the highest value of the range shall be used for the

portion is used for energy may consider applying the flare efficiency to the portion of the
biogas used for energy, if separate measurements of the respective flows are not
performed. When the amount of methane that is combusted for energy and that is flared
is separately monitored, or when only the biogas flow to the flare is monitored and the
biogas used for energy is calculated based on electricity generation, a destruction
efficiency of 100% can be used for the amount that is combusted for energy.
34. Where applicable, the proper soil application (not resulting in methane emissions) of the
residual waste shall be monitored.
35. The monitoring plan should include on-site inspections for each individual farm included
in the project boundary where the project activity is implemented for each verification
period.
36. If the option in paragraph 17(a) is chosen for baseline emission determination,
(a) The PDD shall describe the system used for monitoring the fraction of the manure
handled in the animal manure management system (MS%,i,y), the average weight
of the livestock (Wsite) and the livestock population (NLT,y) taking into account the
average number of days the animals are alive in the farm in a specific year. The
consistency between these values and indirect information (records of sales,
records of food purchases) shall be assessed. Significant changes in livestock
population and average weight shall be explained;
3 If a fuel is defined as a start-up fuel, it should not represent more than 1% of the total fuel utilized in the
process, on energy basis.

Box 2. Non-binding best practice example 3: Procedure to measure Wsite
The project activity will collect and treat the manure from dairy cattle by anaerobic digestion
process, and use the biogas generated during the treatment process for electricity generation.
The project participant would like to use the sampling procedures from the approved
methodology ACM0010”: “Consolidated baseline methodology for GHG emission reductions
from manure management systems” version 10 (Parameter 29). The following provides an
illustration for the sampling plan:
Sampling design
1. Objective and reliability requirements: The objective of the sampling plan is to determine
the average weight of the cattle. The confidence/precision level of 90/10 will be applied.
2. Target population: The target population is the 30,000 cattle in the farm, classified into 5
age categories, i.e. dry cow, milk cow, young cow, growing cow and calf.
3. Sampling method: Stratified random sampling will be carried out. The cattle population will
be classified into 5 age categories as above.
4. Sample size: Approximate equation from the section 2.1.8 of Appendix 1 of “Guideline:
Sampling and surveys for CDM project activities and programmes of activities” version
03.0 is used. A coefficient of variation (V) of 1 is used. The sample size is calculated as
271. After applying a response rate of 90% and 10% contingency, the sample size is
rounded up to 333. (Please see Appendix 1 of “Guideline: Sampling and surveys for CDM
project activities and programmes of activities” version 03.0 for the example of the
calculation of sampling size. Or alternatively use the sample size calculator available at
<https://cdm.unfccc.int/Reference/Guidclarif/index.html>.
5. Sampling frame: Sampling frame is worked out independently by taking categories as
sampling unit. Sampled group will be changed in each monitoring period. Based on the
data available on 13/12/2012, when some cows have not been put into the farm, the
sample size for each age category is determined as follows:
Data
1. Field Measurements: For each sampled cow, the weight will be monthly monitored with
the scale installed at the farm by project owner.
2. Quality Assurance/Quality Control: Every technician to monitor the sampled cow will fill in
the date and signature; the monitor forms will be collected, summarized and kept by the
project participant. In addition, the scale will be calibrated annually.
3. Data analysis: The primary monitoring data are collected and used to calculate GHG
emission reductions.
Implementation plan
The project participant will establish the detailed measurement plan and train the employees in
the farm to collect the data, and the data shall be summarized and analyzed by the CDM
manager.

The project activity will capture methane from manure in a covered anaerobic lagoon in a
poultry farm. The captured methane will be used for electricity generation in a gas engine. The
project participant opts to use the default value of 60% dry basis instead of measuring the
methane content. Therefore, the project participant monitors the flow of biogas (Bburnt,y) on a

Version 21.0

Box 4. Non-binding best practice example 5: Measurement of temperature and pressure
of the biogas (Data/Parameter table 7 and 8)
The project participant wishes to carry out sampling to determine the temperature of the biogas
with 90/10 confidence/precision level. The project proponent estimates the average temperature
of the biogas (mean) to be 34 °C. Based on the information from other CDM projects or other
projects in the region, the project participant estimates the standard deviation (SD) to be 6 °C.
The number of measurements required to meet the 90/10 reliability is calculated according to:
𝒏 = ( 𝒕𝒏−𝟏×𝑺𝑫
𝟎.𝟏×𝒎𝒆𝒂𝒏)𝟐
Where tn-1 is the value of the t-distribution for 90% confidence for a sample size of n. However,
the sample size is not yet known, and so the first step is to use the value for 90% confidence
when the sample is large, i.e. 1.645, and then refine the calculation:
𝒏 = (𝟏.𝟔𝟒𝟓×𝟔
𝟎.𝟏×𝟑𝟒 )𝟐
= 𝟖. 𝟒, rounded up to 9. The exact value for tn-1 can be acquired from any set of
general statistical tables or using standard statistical software. For a sample size of 9 the value
is 1.860. The calculation now gives 𝒏 = (𝟏.𝟖𝟔𝟎×𝟔
𝟎.𝟏×𝟑𝟒 )𝟐
= 𝟏𝟎. 𝟕𝟕, which rounds up to 11. This process
is iterated until there is no change to the value of n. Here the repeated calculation would result
in a t-value of 1.812 and the calculation would yield n = 10.22, which would be rounded up to
11. The sample size calculation suggests that to accommodate 11 measurements per year,
sampling every five weeks should be sufficient for 90/10 reliability. For simplification, monthly
measurement, corresponding to 12 measurements per year, will be done.
For the biogas pressure, the same sampling plan also applies. Considering the expected biogas
pressure of 900 mbar and the SD of 120 mbar, the calculation results in 7 measurements per
year. For simplification, the sampling for biogas pressure will be done on a monthly basis,
corresponding to 12 measurements per year, carried out at the same time as the measurement
for the biogas temperature.

programme of activities:
(a) If the project activity involves the replacement of equipment, and the leakage effect
of the use of the replaced equipment in another activity is neglected, because the
replaced equipment is scrapped, an independent monitoring of scrapping of
replaced equipment needs to be implemented. The monitoring should include a
check if the number of project activity equipment distributed by the project and the
number of scrapped equipment correspond with each other. For this purpose,
scrapped equipment should be stored until such correspondence has been
checked. The scrapping of replaced equipment should be documented and
independently verified.
