1. Introduction
1. The following table describes the key elements of the methodology:
Table 1. Methodology key elements
Typical project(s) Recovery and combustion of methane from manure or a
mixture of manure and other agricultural wastes through:
• Installation of a methane recovery and combustion system
to an existing source of methane emissions; or
• Change in the management practice for manure to achieve
controlled anaerobic digestion (domestic biogas digester)
that is equipped with a methane recovery and combustion
system.
Type of GHG emissions
mitigation action
GHG destruction:
• Combustion of methane and displacement of more-GHG-
intensive energy generation
2. Scope, applicability, and entry into force
2.1. Scope
2. This methodology covers project activities involving the recovery and combustion of
methane from manure or a mixture of manure and other agricultural wastes1 that would
decay anaerobically and emit methane to the atmosphere in the absence of the project
activity. Recovery and combustion of methane can be achieved either by:
(a) Installing a methane recovery and combustion system to an existing source of
methane emissions; or
(b) Changing a manure management practice to achieve controlled anaerobic
digestion by installing a domestic biogas digester equipped with a methane
recovery and combustion system.
2.2. Applicability
3. The methodology is applicable under the following conditions:
(a) The domestic biogas digester, methane recovery and combustion systems are
installed at individual households or small farms ;
(b) This methodology may be applied in combination with “AMS-I.C.: Thermal energy
production with or without electricity” and/or “AMS-I.I.: Biogas/biomass thermal
applications for households/small users” and/or “AMS-I.E.: Switch from non-
renewable biomass for thermal applications by the user”;
(c) This methodology is applicable only to the fraction of the manure which would
decay anaerobically in the absence of the project activity. The fraction of the
1 A small amount of “other agricultural wastes” can be mixed but the baseline emissions arising from “other
agricultural waste” cannot be reflected in the emission reductions.

manure decaying anaerobically is established by a survey in accordance with
paragraph 12 below;
(d) The annual average temperature of the site where manure would have
decomposed anaerobically in the baseline is higher than 5 °C.
4. The project activity shall satisfy the following conditions:
(a) The average annual emission reductions achieved by each domestic biogas
digester, methane recovery and combustion system is less than or equal to five
tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e) per system;2

the aerobic handling of the final digestate (e.g. land application) shall be described
in the project design document (PDD) and subsequently checked upon verification;
(c) Measures shall be used (e.g. combustion in a biogas burner for cooking needs) to
ensure that all the methane collected by the recovery system is combusted;.
(d) In order to mitigate risks for physical leakage and venting, project participants shall
provide documentation in the PDD which:
(i) Ensures that biodigesters are appropriately designed in terms of their sizing,
considering manure inputs and the thermal energy requirements of
households. Justifications shall be provided in the PDD and monitoring
reports to demonstrate that gasholders are sufficiently large to capture and
store all the biogas that would be generated until consumption;
(ii) Ensures that the construction or installation of biodigesters (in the case of
prefabricated plants) complies with relevant national and/or international
standards and that a quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) system is put
in place for the construction or installation;

commissioning or installation and that the trainings shall be documented in
a verifiable manner (e.g. protocol of trainings, documentation of on-site
visits);
(iv) Ensures that a plan for periodic inspection and maintenance is in place and
rehabilitation services are available throughout the crediting period.
Description of such technical support system shall be provided in the PDD
and verified by the designated operational entity (DOE) during verification. If
the rehabilitation is undertaken, the details (e.g. parts replaced,
specifications followed, personnel conducting the repairs and date of
retrofitting) on each domestic biogas digester, methane recovery and
combustion system shall be documented.
(e) Aggregated annual emission reductions of all systems included shall be less than
or equal to 60 kilotonnes of CO2e.

5.2. Baseline
11. In the absence of the project activity, manure and wastes from agricultural activities are
left to decay anaerobically within the project boundary and methane is emitted to the
atmosphere.
12. The fraction of total annual volatile solids for each livestock type LT that is treated in a
manure management system MS in climate region k (𝐴𝑊𝑀𝑆𝐿𝑇,𝑀𝑆,𝑘) is determined by a
survey of a sample group of households/small farms participating in the project activity
with a 90 per cent confidence interval and 10 per cent margin of error. The survey should
determine the baseline animal manure management practices applied. If the livestock is
raised in shared centralized farms,3 the project participant shall be able to show the
baseline animal manure management practices at each farm, either individually or through
sampling.
13. Baseline emissions (BEy) are calculated as follows4:
𝐵𝐸𝑦 = ∑ (𝑁𝐿𝑇,𝑃𝑆,𝑦 × 𝐴𝑀𝐿𝑇,𝑃𝑆
103 × 𝑉𝑆_𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒𝐿𝑇,𝑃𝑆 × 365 × 𝐵𝑜𝐿𝑇,𝑃𝑆 × 0.67
𝐿𝑇,𝑀𝑆,𝑃𝑆,𝑘
× 10−3 × 𝑀𝐶𝐹𝐿𝑇,𝑀𝑆,𝑘
100 × 𝐴𝑊𝑀𝑆𝐿𝑇,𝑀𝑆,𝑘) × 𝐺𝑊𝑃𝐶𝐻4 × 𝑈𝐹𝑏
Equation (1)
Where:
𝐵𝐸𝑦 = Baseline emission during the year y ( tCO2e)
𝑁𝐿𝑇,𝑃𝑆,𝑦 = Annual average number of animals of livestock type LT in year y for
productivity system5 PS (i.e. high or low) (numbers), determined as per
Data/parameter table 1
𝐴𝑀𝐿𝑇,𝑦 = Animal mass for livestock type LT (kilogram (kg) per animal), determined
as per Data/parameter table 2
𝑉𝑆_𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒𝐿𝑇,𝑃𝑆 = Daily volatile solid excretion per head of livestock type LT, for productivity
system PS (i.e. high or low) (kg VS per 1,000 kg animal mass per day).
Use default values as provided in Table 10.13A of chapter ‘Emissions
from Livestock and Manure Management’ under the volume ‘Agriculture,
Forestry and other Land use’ of the 2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC
Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories
365 = Days per year
3 In shared centralized farms systems, multiple households raise their animals in a centralized farm, for
example in separate barns of a centralized farm. In the project activity, each family collects the manure
of animals raised by it at the centralized farm and uses the collected manures as feedstock for the
biodigester situated at the household.
4 Refer to the chapter ‘Emissions from Livestock and Manure Management’ in the volume ‘Agriculture,
Forestry and other Land use’ of the 2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National
Greenhouse Gas Inventories.

14. Project activity emissions consist of:
(a) Physical leakage of biogas (PEPL,y);
(b) CO2 emissions from use of fossil fuels for the operation of all the installed facilities
(PEFC,y);
(c) CO2 emissions from use of electricity for the operation of all the installed facilities
(PEEC,y);

Where:
𝑃𝐸𝑦 = Project emissions in year y (tCO2e)
𝑃𝐸𝑃𝐿,𝑦 = Emissions due to physical leakage of biogas in year y (tCO2e)
𝑃𝐸𝐹𝐶,𝑦 = Emissions from the use of fossil fuel for the operation of the system in the
year y (tCO2e)
𝑃𝐸𝐸𝐶,𝑦 = Emissions from the use of electricity for the operation of the system in the
year y (tCO2e)

× 𝐺𝑊𝑃𝐶𝐻4
Equation (3)
16. Project emissions from use of fossil fuels (𝑃𝐸𝐹𝐶,𝑦) or electricity (𝑃𝐸𝐸𝐶,𝑦) for the operation
of the system shall be estimated using TOOL03 and TOOL05 . When applying the above
tools, default values contained in TOOL14 may be used.

to use of biomass (other agricultural wastes), if applicable.
5.5. Emission reductions
18. Project participants shall undertake direct measurement of the amount of biogas
consumed by the thermal application. The emission reductions8 achieved in any year are
the lowest value of the following:
𝐸𝑅𝑦 = 𝑚𝑖𝑛[(𝐵𝐸𝑦 × 𝑛𝑘,𝑦 − 𝑃𝐸𝑃𝐿,𝑦 − 𝑃𝐸𝐹𝐶,𝑦 − 𝑃𝐸𝐸𝐶,𝑦), (𝑀𝐷𝑦 − 𝑃𝐸𝐹𝐶,𝑦
− 𝑃𝐸𝐸𝐶,𝑦)] − 𝐿𝐸𝑦
Equation (4)
Where:
𝐸𝑅𝑦 = Emission reductions achieved by the project activity for year y (tCO2e)
𝑛𝑘,𝑦 = Proportion of domestic biogas digester, methane recovery and
combustion systems k commissioned that remain operating in year y
(fraction)
𝑀𝐷𝑦 = Methane combusted by the project activity in year y (tCO2e)
𝑃𝐸𝑦 = Project emissions for year y (tCO2e)
𝐿𝐸𝑦 = Leakage for year y (tCO2e)
7 Leakage rate of 0.1 for low quality biogas digesters provided in the 2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC
Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories is proposed for conservativeness.
8 The emission reductions achieved by energy displacement are estimated and monitored according to
one of the methodologies listed in paragraph 3 (b).

6. Monitoring methodology
20. Emission reductions can only be claimed if the systems are demonstrated to be
operational and commissioned in compliance with standards and/or manufacturer’s
requirements. It shall be verified if the amount of manure generated and fed to the digester,
which is estimated as per paragraph 13 above, is consistent with the capacity of the
biogas digester system.
21. The proper land application (resulting in negligible methane emissions) of the digestate
shall be verified on a sampling basis following requirements in the “Standard for sampling
and surveys for CDM project activities and programme of activities”.
9 This is to account for uncertainties of the questionnaire survey method, estimated to be in the range 30–
50 per cent (See Annex III (Table of conservativeness factors), document
FCCC/SBSTA/2003/10/Add.2).
10 Biogas volume and methane content measurements shall be on the same basis (wet or dry).

Measurement
procedures (if any):
(a) Biogas flow meters shall be used to monitor accumulated biogas
supplied to thermal energy equipment:
• Measurement campaigns shall be undertaken at randomly
selected sample sites in each year of the crediting period;
• The “Standard: Sampling and surveys for CDM project
activities and programme of activities” shall be used for
determining the sample size to achieve 90/10
confidence/precision levels;
• The selected samples should take into account the need for
stratification, as deemed appropriate, of the population
according to the capacity, types and region where the
digesters are installed (e.g. 6 cubic metre or 8 cubic metre
capacity, fixed dome or floating dome type, regions where
seasons influence average ambient temperature);
• For each measurement campaign at each site, continuous
measurement shall be carried out for at least 30 days;
• To account for seasonal variation in biogas generation from
biogas digesters, it may be measured over a year during
several disjointed periods (e.g. one week per quarter), but still
covering at least 30 days for a year. These figures are then
turned into an annual figure for a biogas digester. However, if
disjointed periods are not practical or too expensive, then a
single period may be chosen, from which an annualized figure
is derived taking into account seasonality. If adjustment for
seasonality is not possible, then a conservative approach
shall be taken where a single period is chosen corresponding
to the least amount of biogas generation, which is then scaled.
