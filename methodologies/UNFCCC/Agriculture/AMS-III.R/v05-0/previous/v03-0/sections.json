Emission reductions can only be applied to systems that are demonstrated to be operational and in compliance with manufacturer required maintenance procedures, at least once every two years (biennial) during the crediting period. After the inspection and acceptance testing at year of installation, the inspections can be done in years 3, 5, 7, etc. and the results of such inspections can be applied to crediting years 3 and 4, 5 and 6, 7 and 8 etc. On-going rental/lease payments or a recurring maintenance fee by users can be a substitute to actual site visits. A statistically valid sample of the residences where the systems are installed, with consideration, in the sampling design, of occupancy and demographic differences can be used to determine the percentage of systems operating, as per the relevant requirements for sampling in the “Standard for sampling and surveys for CDM project activities and programme of activities”.

On the other hand, when the project proponent chooses to inspect annually, a 90% confidence interval and 10% margin of error requirement shall be achieved for the sampling parameter; (c) Survey methods are used to determine the annual average animal population (NLT), the amount of waste/animal manure generated on the farm and the amount of waste/animal manure fed into the system e.g. biogas digester (It shall be verified if the manure fed to the digester is consistent with the animal population and with the capacity of the system). If the livestock is raised in the shared centralized farms, the project proponent shall also determine the number of families/households sharing the farm and the annual average animal population (NLT) belonging to each household; (d) The proper soil application (not resulting in methane emissions) of the final sludge verified on a sampling basis.
