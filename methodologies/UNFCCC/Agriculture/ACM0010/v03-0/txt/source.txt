Applicability
This methodology is applicable generally to manure management on livestock farms where the existing
anaerobic manure treatment system, within the project boundary, is replaced by one or a combination of
more than one animal waste management systems (AWMSs) that result in less GHG emissions.
This methodology is applicable to manure management projects with the following conditions:

• 	Farms where livestock populations, comprising of cattle, buffalo, swine, sheep, goats, and/or poultry,
is managed under confined conditions.
• 	Farms where manure is not discharged into natural water resources (e.g. rivers or estuaries).
• 	In case of anaerobic lagoons treatments systems, the depth of the lagoons used for manure
management under the baseline scenario should be at least 1m2 .
• 	The annual average temperature in the site where the anaerobic manure treatment facility in the
baseline existed is higher than 5°C.
• 	In the baseline case, the minimum retention time of manure waste in the anaerobic treatment system is
greater than 1 month.
• 	The AWMS/process in the project case should ensure that no leakage of manure waste into ground
water takes place, e.g., the lagoon should have a non-permeable layer at the lagoon bottom.
This baseline methodology shall be used in conjunction with the approved monitoring methodology
ACM0010 (Consolidated baseline methodology for GHG emission reductions from manure management
systems).
Identification of the baseline scenario
The methodology determines the baseline scenario through the following steps:
Step I: 	Define alternative scenarios to the proposed CDM project activity.
Step II: 	Barriers analysis.
Step III: 	Investment analysis.
Step IV: 	Baseline revision at renewal of crediting period.
Step 1: Define alternative scenarios to the proposed CDM project activity
1. 	Identify realistic and credible alternative scenarios that are available either to the project
participants or to other potential project developers3 for managing the manure. These alternative scenarios
should include:
• 	The proposed project activity not being registered as a CDM project activity.
• 	All other plausible and credible alternatives to the project activity scenario, including the common
practices in the relevant sector. In doing so, the complete set of possible manure management
systems listed in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (Chapter 10,
Table 10.17) should be taken into account. In drawing up a list of possible scenarios, possible
combinations of different Animal Waste Management Systems (AWMS) should be taken into
account.
2 In particular, loading in the waste water streams has to be high enough to assure that the lagoon develops an
anaerobic bottom layer and that algal oxygen production can be ruled out.
3 For example, a coal-fired power station or hydropower may not be an alternative for an independent power
producer investing in wind energy or for a sugar factory owner investing in a co-generation, but may be an
alternative for a public utility. As a result, the proposed project may be able to avoid emissions that would have
occurred from the coal-fired power station that would have been built (or built earlier) by the utility in the absence of
the CDM. Therefore, there may be cases where the baseline scenario includes an alternative that is not accessible to
the project participant. However, there are also cases where all the alternatives are accessible to the project
participant: for instance, this may be the case for projects flaring landfill gas, improving boilers, etc.

• 	If applicable, continuation of the current situation (no project activity or other alternatives
undertaken).
Eliminate alternatives that are not in compliance with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements.
Apply Sub-step 1b of the latest version of the “Tool for demonstration assessment and of additionality”.
For the purpose of identifying alternative scenarios that are common practice, provide an analysis of other
manure management practices implemented previously or currently underway. Projects are considered
similar if they are in the same country/region, are of a similar scale, and take place in a comparable
environment with respect to regulatory framework, investment climate, access to technology, access to
financing, etc. Other CDM project activities are not to be included in this analysis. Provide documented
evidence. On the basis of that analysis, identify and include all alternative scenarios that are common
practice.
Step 2: Barrier analysis
Establish a complete list of barriers that would prevent alternative scenarios to occur in the absence of the
CDM. Such barriers may include:
Investment barriers, inter alia:
- 	Debt funding is not available for this type of innovative activities.
- 	Neither access to international capital markets due to real or perceived risks associated
with domestic or foreign direct investment in the country where the project activity is to
be implemented.
Technological barriers, inter alia:
- 	Skilled and/or properly trained labour to operate and maintain the technology is not
available and no education/training institution in the host country provides the needed
skill, leading to equipment disrepair and malfunctioning.
- 	Lack of infrastructure for implementation of the technology.
Barriers due to prevailing practice, inter alia:
- 	The alternative is the “first of its kind”: No alternative of this type is currently operational
in the host country or region.
Since the proposed project activity not being registered as a CDM project activity shall be one of the
considered alternatives, any barrier that may prevent the project activity to occur shall be included in that
list.
Provide transparent and documented evidence, and offer conservative interpretations of this documented
evidence, as to how it demonstrates the existence and significance of the identified barriers. Anecdotal
evidence can be included, but alone is not sufficient proof of barriers. The type of evidence to be provided
may include:
(a) 	Relevant legislation, regulatory information or industry norms;
(b) 	Relevant (sectoral) studies or surveys (e.g. market surveys, technology studies, etc)
undertaken by universities, research institutions, industry associations, companies,
bilateral/multilateral institutions, etc;
(c) 	Relevant statistical data from national or international statistics;
(d) 	Documentation of relevant market data (e.g. market prices, tariffs, rules);

UNFCCC/CCNUCC

Sectoral Scopes: 13 and 15
EB 35
4/38
(e) 	Written documentation from the company or institution developing or implementing the
CDM project activity or the CDM project developer, such as minutes from Board
meetings, correspondence, feasibility studies, financial or budgetary information, etc;
(f) 	Documents prepared by the project developer, contractors or project partners in the
context of the proposed project activity or similar previous project implementations;
(g) 	Written documentation of independent expert judgments from industry, educational
institutions (e.g. universities, technical schools, training centers), industry associations and
others.
Assess for all barriers identified which scenario alternatives would be prohibited from being implemented
by the barrier and eliminate those alternatives from further consideration.
If there is only one scenario alternative that is not prevented by any barrier, and
i. 	If this alternative is not the proposed project activity not being registered as a CDM project activity,
then this scenario alternative is the most plausible baseline scenario.
ii. 	If this alternative is the proposed project activity not being registered as a CDM project activity,
then the project activity is the most plausible baseline scenario.
iii. 	If there are still several baseline scenario alternatives remaining, either go to Step III (investment
analysis) or choose the alternative with the lowest emissions (i.e. the most conservative) as the most
plausible baseline scenario.
Step 3: Investment analysis
Undertake investment analysis of all the alternatives that do not face any barriers, as identified in Step II.
For each alternative, all costs and economic benefits attributable to the waste management scenario should
be illustrated in a transparent and complete manner, as shown in Table 1 below.

project related products, when applicable

For each alternative baseline scenario, the internal rate of return (IRR) and/or the net present value (NPV)
should be calculated. The calculation of the IRR must include inter alia investment costs, operation and
maintenance costs, as well as any other appropriate costs (engineering, consultancy, etc.). Similarly, take
into consideration all revenues generated by each manure management scenario, including revenue from

the sale of electricity and cost savings due to avoided electricity purchases and other sources of income
related to the implementation of the project, except revenues from the sale of CERs.
The IRR for all alternative scenarios should be calculated in a conservative manner. To ensure this,
assumptions and parameters for the proposed project activity, if still under consideration, should be chosen
in a conservative way such that they tend to lead to a higher IRR and NPV. For all other scenarios
considered, assumptions and parameters should be chosen in a way such that they tend to lead to a lower
IRR and NPV. This conservative choice of parameters and assumptions should be ensured by obtaining
expert opinions and should be evaluated by the DOE as part of the validation of the project activity.
If the IRR cannot be calculated due to the existence of only negative flows in the financial analysis, the
comparison should be based on the NPV, stating explicitly the discount rate used.
The baseline scenario is identified as the economically most attractive course of action i.e., alternative
scenario with highest IRR or NPV, where the IRR cannot be calculated
Step 4: Baseline revision
Renewal of crediting period: The project participants, at the renewal of each credit period, will undertake
the relevance of baseline scenario identified above taking into account change in the relevant national
and/or sectoral regulations between two crediting periods as well as any increase in the animal stock above
the pre-project animal stock. This assessment will be undertaken by the verifying DOE.
Additionality
If the baseline determination in this methodology (see section "Identification of the baseline scenario"
above) demonstrates that the baseline is different from the proposed project activity not undertaken as a
CDM project activity it may be concluded that the project is additional.

(B) Maximum Methane Production Potential (B0,LT):
This value varies by species and diet. Where default values are used, they should be taken from tables
10A-4 through 10A-9 (IPCC 2006 Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories volume 4, chapter
10) specific to the country where the project is implemented.
Developed countries B 0,LT values can be used provided the following conditions are satisfied:
• 	The genetic source of the production operations livestock originate from an Annex I Party
• 	The farm use formulated feed rations (FFR) which are optimized for the various animal(s),
stage of growth, category, weight gain/productivity and/or genetics
• 	The use of FFR can be validated (through on-farm record keeping, feed supplier, etc.)
• 	The project specific animal weights are more similar to developed country IPCC default
values
(C) Methane conversion factors (MCFs):
• 	The IPCC 2006 MCF values given in table 10.17 (chapter 10, volume 4) should be used, which is
attached here as Annex 3. MCF values depend on the annual average temperature where the
anaerobic manure treatment facility in the baseline existed. For average annual temperatures
below 10 o C and above 5 o
C, a linear interpolation should be used to estimate the MCF value at the
specific temperature assuming an MCF value of 0 at an annual average of 5 o C. Future revisions
to the IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories should be taken into account.
• 	A conservativeness factor should be applied by multiplying MCF values (estimated as per above
bullet) with a value of 0.94, , to account for the 20% uncertainty in the MCF values as reported by
IPCC 2006.
For subsequent treatment stages, the reduction of the volatile solids during a treatment stage is estimated
based on referenced data for different treatment types. Emissions from the next treatment stage are then
calculated following the approach outlined above, but with volatile solids adjusted for the reduction from
the previous treatment stages by multiplying by (1 - RVS), where RVS is the relative reduction of volatile
solids from the previous stage. The relative reduction (RVS) of volatile solids depends on the treatment
technology and should be estimated in a conservative manner. Default values for different treatment
technologies can be found in Table 8.10 of chapter 8.2 in US-EPA (2001).4 These values are provided in

Determination of CEF Bl,elec:
• 	In cases where electricity would in the absence of the project activity be generated in an on-site fossil
fuel fired power plant, project participants should use for CEF Bl,elec, the default emission factor for a
diesel generator with a capacity of more than 200 kW for small-scale project activities
(0.8 tCO2 /MWh, see Table I.D.1 in the simplified baseline and monitoring methodology AMS.I.D for
selected small-scale CDM project activity categories).
• 	In cases where electricity would, in the absence of the project activity, be purchased from the grid, the
emission factor CEF Bl,elec should be calculated according to approved methodology “Tool for
calculation of emission factor for electricity systems” . If electricity consumption is less than small
scale threshold (15 GWh/yr), use the default emission factor for a diesel generator with a capacity of
more than 200 kW for small-scale project activities (0.8 tCO2 /MWh, see Table I.D.1 in the simplified
baseline and monitoring methodology AMS.I.D for selected small-scale CDM project activity
categories).
Determination of CEF grid:
CEF grid should be calculated according to “Tool for calculation of emission factor for electricity systems”.
Determination of CEF Bl,therm:
CEF Bl,therm is the CO2 emissions intensity for thermal energy generation (tCO2e/MJ).
Baseline electricity and thermal energy consumptions should be estimated as the average of the historical
3 years consumption.

Project Emissions
The project activity might include one or more AWMS to treat the manure. For example, the manure
might be first treated in an anaerobic digester and the treated waste might be further processed using an
aerobic pond. Each AWMS is referred to as a treatment stage.
Project emissions are estimated as follows:

PE Aer, y 	Methane emissions from AWMS that aerobically treats the manure in t CO2e/yr

PE PL,y 	Physical leakage of emissions from biogas network to flare the captured methane or
supply to the facility where it is used for heat and/or electricity generation in t CO2e/yr
PE flare,y 	Project emissions from flaring of the residual gas stream in t CO2e/yr
PE elec/heat 	Project emissions from use of heat and/or electricity in the project case in t CO2e/yr
(i) Methane emissions from AWMS where gas is captured (PEAD, y):
IPCC guidelines specify physical leakage from anaerobic digesters as being 15% of total biogas
production. Where project participants use lower values for percentage of physical leakage, they should
provide measurements proving that this lower value is appropriate for the project.
Ex-ante leakage to be reported in the CDM-PDD will be estimated using equation 11.a or 11.b below, with
a leakage factor of 0.15 or a lower value, if properly justified through documented evidence (which should
be validated by the DOE).
If project case AWMS is anaerobic digester only, then use equation (11.a), else use equation (11.b).

calculated following the approach outlined above, but with nitrogen adjusted for the reduction from the
previous treatment stages by multiplying by (1-RN), where RN is the relative reduction of nitrogen from the
previous stage. The relative reduction (R N) of nitrogen depends on the treatment technology and should be
estimated in a conservative manner. Default values for different treatment technologies can be found in
Chapter 8.2 in US-EPA (2001).6 These values are provided in Annex 1.
(iv) Physical Leakage from distribution network of the captured methane in (PEPL)
This refers to leaks in the biogas system from the biogas pipeline delivery system. The sum of the
quantities of captured methane fed to the flare, to the power plant and to the boiler (measured as per the
monitoring plan) must be compared annually with the total methane generated as measured by meter at
the outlet of the methane generating digester. The difference between the monitored value of methane
generated and that consumed in flare/electricity generation/heat shall be accounted as leakage from the
pipelines.
In the case where biogas is just flared and the pipeline from collection point to flare is short (i.e., less than
1 km, and for on site delivery only), one flow meter can be used. In such cases the physical leakage may
be considered as zero. .
(v) Project emissions from flaring of the residual gas stream (PE flare,y):
The combustion of biogas methane may give rise to significant methane emissions as a result of
incomplete or inefficient combustion.
Project emissions from flaring of the residual gas stream should be determined following the procedure
described in the “Tool to determine project emissions from flaring gases containing Methane”.

emissions from electricity consumption (PEElec,y = PE EC,y) will be calculated following the
latest version of “Tool to calculate project emissions from electricity consumption”. In
case, the electricity consumption is not measured then the electricity consumption shall be
estimated as follows:

y,i	y,	PJ 	8760	*	CP	EC 	, where CP i,y is the rated capacity (in MW) of electrical
equipment i used for project activity.

fossil fuel combustion (PEheat,j,y = PEFC,j,y ) will be calculated following the latest version
of “Tool to calculate project or leakage CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion”. For
this purpose, the processes j in the tool corresponds to all fossil fuel combustion in the
paper plant established as part of the project activity, as well as any other on-site fuel
combustion for the purposes of the project activity.

Further, in estimating emissions reduction for claiming certified emissions reductions, if the calculated
CH4 baseline emissions from anaerobic lagoons are higher than the measured CH4 generated in the
anaerobic digester in the project situation (this is calculated as product of biogas flow at the digester outlet
and methane fraction in the biogas), then the latter shall be used to calculate the emissions reduction for
claiming certified emissions reductions. Therefore, the actual methane captured from an anaerobic
digester shall be compared to the (BECH4,y - PEAD,y - PE PL,y) and if found lower, then (BECH4,y - PE AD,y -
PE PL,y) ( which is a component of BEy -PEy )in equation (29) is replaced by actual methane captured.

Monitoring Methodology
In this methodology, monitoring comprises several activities.
The monitoring plan should include on site inspections for each individual farm included in the project
boundary where the project activity is implemented for each verification period.
Baseline emissions:
• 	Diagrammatic representation of animal waste management system existing on the project site prior to
project implementation.
• 	Parameters MCF, Bo , and RVS for estimating methane emissions from AWMS in the baseline.
• 	EF N2O and RN for estimating nitrogen emission from AWMS in the baseline;
• 	Ambient temperature at the AWMS site;
• 	Amount of electricity used for the operation of the AWMS in the baseline;
• 	Amount of fossil fuel used for the operation of the AWMS in the baseline;
• 	Biogas based electricity exported to the grid, needs to be monitored only if emissions reduction for
electricity generation from biogas are claimed;
• 	Data and parameters for estimating heat and electricity emission factors.
Project emissions:
• 	The livestock populations by different livestock types. This includes the number of heads of each
population and the average animal weight in each population;
• 	Parameters MCF, Bo , and RVS for estimating methane emissions from AWMSs in the project case.
• 	EF N2O and RN for estimating nitrogen emission from AWMS in the baseline.
• 	The default volatile solid excretion values or other parameters required for estimating the volatile
solids. If dietary intake method is used, the feed intake of animals and its energy will be monitored.

• 	Leakage from anaerobic digester, if used. The default value is 15%, but in case project participants
use a lower value, the appropriate measurement to support the lower value shall be monitored and
reported.
• 	The default nitrogen excretion per animal or parameters required to estimate nitrogen excretion. If N
intake method is used the amount of dry matter intake by livestock shall be monitored.
• 	Amount of electricity used in the project case. If electricity consumption is measured in the project,
then project proponents may use the “Tool to calculate project emissions from electricity
consumption”.
• 	Fuel consumption for generation of heat used in the project case. Calculated following the latest
version of “Tool to calculate project or leakage CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion”.
• 	Flow of biogas to the flare, heat generation, and electricity generation. In the case where biogas is just
flared, one flow meter can be used provided that the meter used is calibrated periodically by an
officially accredited entity.
• 	Concentration of methane in biogas at outlet of anaerobic digester, this shall be measured on wet
basis.
• 	The parameters used for determining the project emissions from flaring of the residual gas stream in
year y (PE flare,y) should be monitored as per the “Tool to determine project emissions from flaring
gases containing Methane”.
• 	Biogas leakage in project: through leaks in the pipeline during transportation of biogas.
