The methodology allows use of mangrove species and non-\nmangrove species but in case of more than 10 per cent area being covered by planting\nof non-mangrove species it prohibits changes in the hydrology of the project area. The\nmethodology restricts the extent of soil disturbance in the project to be no more than 10\nper cent. Project activities applying this methodology may choose to exclude or include\naccounting of any of the carbon pools of dead wood and soil organic carbon, but cannot\ninclude the litter carbon pool.\n2. Scope, applicability, and entry into force\n2.1. Scope\n2.\nThis methodology applies to afforestation and reforestation (A/R) project activities\nimplemented in degraded mangrove habitats.\n2.2. Applicability\n3.\nThis methodology is applicable under the following conditions:\n(a)\n(b)\nThe land subject to the project activity is degraded mangrove habitat;\nMore than 90 per cent of the project area is planted with mangrove species. If\nmore than 10 per cent of the project area is planted with non-mangrove species\nthen the project activity does not lead to alteration of hydrology of the project\narea and hydrology of connected up-gradient and down-gradient wetland area;\n(c)\nSoil disturbance attributable to the A/R clean development mechanism (CDM)\nproject activity does not cover more than 10 per cent of area.1\n4.\nA project activity applying this methodology shall also comply with the applicability\nconditions of the tools contained within the methodology and applied by the project\nactivity.\n2.3. Entry into force\n5.\nThe date of entry into force of the revision is the date of the publication of the EB 75\nmeeting report on 4 October 2013."
