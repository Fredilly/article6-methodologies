# Phase-1 Ingestion Docs

## Root cause ledger

- Root-cause entries live in `docs/projects/phase-1-ingestion/ROOT_CAUSE.md`.
- Open the ledger from the CLI with `npm run root-cause:open` to review or append entries right after fixing a new ingest/pipeline failure.

Keep ledger updates in sync with the invariants captured inside `ARTICLE6_INGEST_UPGRADE_PLAN.md`.
