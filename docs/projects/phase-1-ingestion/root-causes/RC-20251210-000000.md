# RC-20251210-000000 - AR-AM0014 tool ref mismatch

- **Name:** AR-AM0014 tool ref mismatch
- **Date:** 2025-12-10
- **Area:** registry / tools / fixtures

## Symptom
- AR-AM0014 `registry.tools[*].pointer` paths did not match the actual tool filenames under `tools/UNFCCC/Forestry/AR-AM0014/v03-0/`.
- The mismatch only surfaced when we aligned Forestry gold fixtures and registry, not via an explicit parity check.

## Root Cause
- Tools for AR-AM0014 were renamed/normalized on disk without updating the corresponding registry entries.
- Forestry-gold fixtures did not include a `tools/` mirror for AR-AM0014, so our tests had no invariant tying tool filenames/paths to `registry.tools[*].pointer`.

## New invariant
- For any methodology that includes tools, the `tools/` directory must be mirrored in the corresponding `tests/fixtures/*-gold/.../tools/` folder, and CI parity checks must enforce that `registry.tools[*].pointer` paths and filenames match the on-disk tool files.

## Spec update
- Update the Phase 7/8 section of `docs/projects/phase-1-ingestion/ARTICLE6_INGEST_UPGRADE_PLAN.md` to:
  - Add the invariant bullet above to the list of ingestion/quality rules.
  - Note that tool parity (registry ↔ filesystem ↔ fixtures) is required before a method is considered Phase-8 complete.

## Code/tests
- Ensure the Forestry/Agriculture gold parity checks include tool paths:
  - Extend the existing parity script or tests to compare `registry.tools[*].pointer` against `tests/fixtures/*-gold/.../tools/*`.
  - Fail CI if any tool entry in `registry.json` lacks a corresponding on-disk file or fixture, or if names/paths diverge.

## Golden fixtures touched
- `tests/fixtures/forestry-gold/UNFCCC/Forestry/AR-AM0014/v03-0/tools/*` (primary exemplar).
- Future Forestry/Agriculture methods with tools should follow the same pattern before being counted as gold exemplars.
